# rospca

[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/rospca)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rospca)

The rospca package contains the implementation of robust sparse PCA
using the ROSPCA algorithm of Hubert et al. (2016). Moreover, the
simulation study and glass dataset discussed in this paper are included.

This package relies heavily on the code from Valentin Todorov for
*rrcov* and on the *mrfDepth* package.

The latest development version of *rospca* can be installed from GitHub
using

    install.packages("remotes")
    
    remotes::install_github("TReynkens/rospca")

If you work on Windows, make sure first that
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is installed
when installing the development version from GitHub.
