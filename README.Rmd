# rospca
[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/rospca)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rospca)

The rospca package contains the implementation of robust sparse PCA using the ROSPCA algorithm of @rospca.
Moreover, the simulation study and glass dataset discussed in this paper are included.

This package relies heavily on the code from Valentin Todorov for *rrcov* and on the *mrfDepth* package.

The latest development version of *rospca* can be installed from GitHub using

```
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("TReynkens/rospca")
```
If you work on Windows, make sure first that [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is installed when installing the development version from GitHub.
